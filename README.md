rorapp
======

My first ruby on rails app.

Simple ROR web app with following features:
================================

1. Product Entry Managmeent
2. Category Entry Management for Products.
3. SubCategory Entry Management for Products.
4. SignIn
5. SingUp
6. Catalog
7. Shopping Cart.
8. CheckOut ( Without Payment gateway Integration )

Application is developed to demonstrate ROR development skills.

Improvements:
========================
1. Test Code using Rspec needs to be committed
2. Simple UI, it can be improved.

Known Issues:
=============================
1. Integration of Bootstrap ver 3 is not correct. May need to rollback to bootstrap ver 2.x

What do you need to setup this app on your local machine ?
================================================
1. Make sure to change database.yml with appropriate database options.
